# Centering a Div is Hard Work

Now with my humble contribution to the coding community, it doesn't have to be.

## About

This project provides a comprehensive and highly efficient method to center a div using media queries for every single pixel width. No longer will you have to struggle with convoluted CSS centering techniques!

## How It Works

By using individual media queries for each pixel width, we ensure that the div remains perfectly centered across all screen sizes. Here is an example snippet of the CSS:

```css
div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightpink;
    position: absolute;
    transform: translateY(-50%);
    top: 50%;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 1920px) {
    div {
        left: calc((1920px - 100px) / 2);
    }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 1919px) {
    div {
        left: calc((1919px - 100px) / 2);
    }
}

@media screen and (max-width: 1918px) {
    div {
        left: calc((1918px - 100px) / 2);
    }
}

/* ... continue the pattern ... */

```
